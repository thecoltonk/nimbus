## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Your Notebook is a complete redesign of our global memory system that centers around autonomous scheduled updates to your Notebook. The Notebook itself is managed behind-the-scenes and is a holistic overview of you. It's currently in the preview stage.
- Added max_tokens parameter to alternative sidebar

### Fixed
- Fixed agentic tool calling (again), it is now more robust and reliable than ever

### Removed
- The old memory system is removed. I would have deprecated it instead, but practically nobody used it anyway so I wanted to keep the code clean without it.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Exa AI API support, with Exa's search API & web crawling API

### Changed
- Removed search option from the alt sidebar and placed it as a button on the message form

- Calling several different types of tools sequentially no longer overwrites the previous tool call type, allowing for more complex/robust agentic scenarios

### Added
- Plethora of new models (from now on, they will not be named in the changelog)

### Changed
- Users will now be required to **set their own API key** to use any models, to avoid overusage on my own API key

### Fixed

- Sidebar no longer pops in and transitions out when you load the site on mobile
- Text now properly wraps, avoiding a horizontal scrollbar

### Removed
